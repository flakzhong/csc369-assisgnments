Discussion:
    The starvation can happen when using this mornitor. 
    (1) crossing: If there is always a car passing from west to east, or from west to 
    south and there is alaways a car passing from south to east or from south to north. 
    Then quadrant 3 and quadrant 4 are alaways locked.For those cars wants to go from 
    north to south or from west to south, they will be starving.

    (2) arriving: If starvation happens on crossing stages, then the starved lane's
     buffer will be full all the time. So its in_cars will never have a chance to
     go into the buffer.
